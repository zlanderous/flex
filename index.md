## A blog about Reinforcement Learning for smallholder farmers

You will find here parts of my ongoing PhD reflections about the use of RL to support smallholder farmers in decision making. That PhD is funded by [CGIAR](https://www.cgiar.org/), [CIRAD](https://www.cirad.fr/en/home-page) and supported by [INRIA](https://www.inria.fr/en/) [SequeL](https://team.inria.fr/sequel/) team, experts of bandits and RL.

If you are not familiar with RL, you will learn what it is and how could it be useful for ag.
