## Hi, I am Romain Gautron

I am currently a PhD student working to apply Reinforcement Learning to enhance decision making that smallholder farmers have to cope with.

I graduated from [AgroParisTech](https://www.agroparistech.fr/) in 2018 as agricultural engineer specialized in Artificial Intelligence. I hold as well a Data Science research oriented master's degree from [Universit√© Paris-Dauphine](https://www.universite-paris-dauphine.fr/). I have been working past year to support [CGIAR](https://www.cgiar.org) BigData Platform about Machine Learning use for food security.

My research interests are at the boundary between Reinforcement Learning and real world applications for food security: how can we use powerful artificial intelligence techniques to provide useful insights to smallholder farmers? I think keeping connection with ground truth is essential for that kind of work, I go on-field as possible.
